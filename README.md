# Tarakeet Rails Challenge

This Rails application is a database for fictional online book-store, implemented as a take-home challenge by Casey Macaulay.

## Iteration 0: Book, Publisher, Author

This challenge asks for a Book model to be created with its corresponding migrations. In looking at the three required fields for Book - title, publisher_id, and author_id - it is clear that all three models are required to correctly build out the relationships. My first step was to design this basic schema:
![alt text](./public/images/author-publisher-book-schema.png "Logo Title Text 1")

Now that I know what schema is necessary to build out my Book model, I'm able to start my Rails application and create the necessary migrations.
